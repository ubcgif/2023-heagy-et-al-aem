	abstract = {Simulations and inversions of electromagnetic geophysical data are paramount for discerning meaningful information about the subsurface from these data. Depending on the nature of the source electromagnetic experiments may be classified as time-domain or frequency-domain. Multiple heterogeneous and sometimes anisotropic physical properties, including electrical conductivity and magnetic permeability, may need be considered in a simulation. Depending on what one wants to accomplish in an inversion, the parameters which one inverts for may be a voxel-based description of the earth or some parametric representation that must be mapped onto a simulation mesh. Each of these permutations of the electromagnetic problem has implications in a numerical implementation of the forward simulation as well as in the computation of the sensitivities, which are required when considering gradient-based inversions. This paper proposes a framework for organizing and implementing electromagnetic simulations and gradient-based inversions in a modular, extensible fashion. We take an object-oriented approach for defining and organizing each of the necessary elements in an electromagnetic simulation, including: the physical properties, sources, formulation of the discrete problem to be solved, the resulting fields and fluxes, and receivers used to sample to the electromagnetic responses. A corresponding implementation is provided as part of the open source simulation and parameter estimation project SIMPEG (http://simpeg.xyz). The application of the framework is demonstrated through two synthetic examples and one field example. The first example shows the application of the common framework for 1D time domain and frequency domain inversions. The second is a field example that demonstrates a 1D inversion of electromagnetic data collected over the Bookpurnong Irrigation District in Australia. The final example is a 3D example which shows how the modular implementation is used to compute the sensitivity for a parametric model where a transmitter is positioned inside a steel cased well.},

	abstract = {The Python-code empymod computes the 3D electromagnetic field in a layered earth with vertical transverse isotropy by combining and extending two earlier presented algorithms in this journal. The bottleneck in frequency- and time-domain calculations of electromagnetic responses derived in the wavenumber-frequency domain is the transformations from the wavenumber to the space domain and from the frequency to the time domain, the so-called Hankel and Fourier transforms. Three different Hankel transform methods (quadrature, quadrature-with-extrapolation [QWE], and filters) and four different Fourier transform methods (fast Fourier transform [FFT], FFTLog, QWE, and filters) are included in empymod, which allows us to compare these different methods in terms of speed and precision. The best transform in terms of speed and precision depends on the modeled frequencies. Published digital filters for the Hankel transform are very fast and precise for frequencies in the range of controlled-source electromagnetic data, but they fail in the frequency range of ground-penetrating radar. Conventional quadrature, on the other hand, is in comparison very slow but can model any frequency. Examples comparing empymod with analytical solutions and with existing electromagnetic modelers illustrate the capabilities of empymod.},

	abstract = {Non-uniqueness in the geophysical inverse problem is well recognized and so too is the ability to obtain solutions with different character by altering the form of the regularization function. Of particular note is the use of ℓp norms with p ∈ [0, 2] which gives rise to sparse or smooth models. Most algorithms are designed to implement a single ℓp norm for the entire model domain. This is not adequate when the fundamental character of the model changes throughout the volume of interest. In such cases we require a generalized regularization function where each sub-volume of the model domain has penalties on smallness and roughness and its own suite of ℓp parameters.Solving the inverse problem using mixed ℓp norms in the regularization (especially for p {\textbackslash}{\textbackslash}\&lt; 1) is computationally challenging. We use the Lawson formulation for the ℓp norm and solve the optimization problem with Iterative Reweighted Least Squares. The algorithm has two stages; we first solve the l2-norm problem and then we switch to the desired suite of ℓp norms; there is one value of p for each term in the objective function. To handle the large changes in numerical values of the regularization function when p values are changed, and to ensure that each component of the regularization is contributing to the final solution, we successively rescale the gradients in our Gauss–Newton solution. An indicator function allows us to evaluate our success in finding a solution in which components of the objective function have been equally influential.We use our algorithm to generate an ensemble of solutions with mixed ℓp norms. This illuminates some of the non-uniqueness in the inverse problem and helps prevent overinterpretation that can occur by having only one solution. In addition, we use this ensemble to estimate the suite of p values that can be used in a final inversion. First, the most common features of our ensemble are extracted using principal component analysis and edge detection procedures; this provides a reference model. A correlation of each member of the ensemble with the reference model, carried out in a windowed domain, then yields a set of p values for each model cell. The efficacy of our technique is illustrated on a synthetic 2-D cross-well example. We then apply our technique to the field example that motivated this research, the 3-D inversion of magnetic data at a kimberlite site in Canada. Since the final regularization terms have different sets of p values in different regions of model space we are able to recover compact regions associated with the kimberlite intrusions, continuous linear features with sharp edges that are associated with dykes and a background that is relatively smooth. The result has a geologic character that would not have been achievable without the use of spatially variable mixed norms.},

In this article, we provide background about this trajectory and discuss how the SEG Distinguished Instructor Short Course was a catalyst in our development of software and resources as well as in our broader goal of creating more collaborative connections within the EM community.},

	abstract = {Working with airborne electromagnetic (AEM) data acquired in the Kaweah Subbasin in the Central Valley of California, USA, we developed a new approach for imaging the bedrock surface and the confining Corcoran Clay layer. Our approach, which incorporated the prior knowledge of the targets for the improved imaging, included multiple L2-norm and Lp-norm inversions as well as an interpolation process. The major improvement in imaging the targets was made in the Lp-norm inversion step by incorporating prior knowledge. For the Corcoran Clay, pairs of resistivity and driller's logs at two wells guided the selection of the primary resistivity model and were used to increase the accuracy of the estimated Corcoran Clay thickness. The bedrock surface was poorly constrained by well data in the existing groundwater model, appearing as a flat surface. Acquired AEM data covered most of the area, so we had higher confidence in the obtained map of the bedrock surface at depths ranging from 15 to 160 m. There was relatively good agreement between the location of the Corcoran Clay in the AEM data (depth ranging from 50 to 130 m and thickness ranging from 3 to 25 m) and the existing groundwater model, with both depth and thickness showing ∼15\% relative difference. The AEM data provided information about the continuity of the Corcoran Clay that is challenging to capture in the well data. The locations of the bedrock and Corcoran Clay were used in a structurally constrained inversion to improve the imaging of the smaller-scale resistivity structure.},
